Introduction:

Unity is a platform for creating and operating real-time 3d contents. This platform can be used not just for game development but also developing many types of AR VR across many different industries, manufacturing, engineering, construction, architecture, media, entertainment and now for industrial simulation including robotics simulation which is what we performed.

Aim: To solving real world problems using Virtual Reality.

Proposed solutions for problems in different sectors
1.Medical Sector:
 In this a application has been created which can be used as a therapy for those peoples who are suffering from height phobia.

2.Education Sector:
A better interactive way of education has been proposed which can help students to visualize the concepts better by simulating the content in virtual environment.

3.Defense Sector:
The proposed method can be used for the training soldiers.It can also be used for shortlisting capable soldiers.

Future Scope:
-Implementation of Machine Learning
 Unity provides plugin for machine learning.It is one of the best platform for implementation of reinforcement learning algorithm as this algorithm involves agent learning from interacting with the environement .Unity as a game engine provides plathora of possibilites of creating Environment and Its scripting features can be used to define the behabiour of the enviornment.
-Augmented Reality
The Unity game engine can be used for AR to find real world solution because it is a powerful tool that can be used to create high quality 3D and 2D games. It also has a large community of developers who can offer support and advice.
-Digital Twin
With advancement in wireless communication technologies Digital Twin has become a hot topic for Research.Digital Twin is representation of real world in virtual environment as much accurately as possible.Unity as a game engine makes it easy to simulate physics in virtual environment.

Tech Stack:
We have used UNITY game engine with Google XR plugin.
